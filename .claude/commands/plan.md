description: Create implementation plan before coding
---

# Plan Mode

Before implementing anything, create a structured plan.

## Instructions

1. **Clarify Understanding**
   - Restate what you understand the request to be
   - List any assumptions you're making
   - Identify questions that should be answered first

2. **Research Phase**
   - Search online if this involves unfamiliar technology
   - Read relevant existing code files
   - Identify patterns already used in this codebase

3. **Design Approach**
   - Outline the proposed solution
   - List files that will be created/modified
   - Identify potential risks or edge cases

4. **Verification Criteria**
   - Define what "done" looks like
   - List test cases that should pass
   - Specify how to verify the implementation works

## Output Format

```markdown
## Plan: [Brief Title]

### Understanding
[Your interpretation of the request]

### Assumptions
- [ ] [Assumption 1]
- [ ] [Assumption 2]

### Questions (if any)
- [Question needing clarification]

### Approach
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.ts` - [what changes]

### Verification
- [ ] [Test case 1]
- [ ] [Test case 2]
```

**Do not proceed to implementation until plan is approved.**
